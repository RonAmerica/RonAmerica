Ron America is Ron Spain.

I started learning BASIC programming around 1990.
In 2005-06, I began learning HTML, JavaScript, and C, and became a lover of open source software.
In 2010-2015, I started learning PHP and switched to Linux.
I started learning Python a few years ago.

I've coded games using OpenGL, custom servers using sockets, and much more working software.
I'm also familiar with Bash and shell scripting, Tcl, GW-BASIC, QBASIC, DOS programming, and some 6502 and x86 assembly.
Much experience managing and publishing projects. You could probably benefit from my help.

I spend my free time retrograming, music-listening, activism-engaging, and entrepreneur-planning.

I will not be going through any extra steps or jumping through any hoops to log in to my account just because some creep working for Microsoft claims it's a good thing. These and many other projects will be accessible at rockymount.us/Ron in the future.

Once again, Microsoft is evil, and these projects seem to benefit in no way from being on GitHub.

This is W R "Ron" Spain, Jr.
